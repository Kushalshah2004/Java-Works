	What is Interface?

	-> interface is a keyword
	-> it is use to achieve abstraction
	-> interface use for Dynamic Method Dispatch
	-> We can inherit interface & create reference variable but can't create object of interface
	-> Declare variable in interface by default (public static final)
	-> There is only abstract methods allowed concrete methods are not allowed
	-> It not contain any constructor
	-> It can't use extend keyword to inherit class.
	-> It support multiple inheritance
